# Deities

People capable of using the Godly element are Deities, of which there can be exactly 90 at any given time. If one were to die, the order of replacement is as follows:

1. Demigods, people granted minor powers by their Deity (demigods of the fallen Deity are prioritized)
2. Children of Deities (children of the fallen Deity are prioritized)
3. Material Plane Races
4. Hell Plane Races
5. Heavenly Plane Races
6. Other Races

The replacement must have a powerful soul and a strong mind, be sentient, and believe in the fallen Deity.
