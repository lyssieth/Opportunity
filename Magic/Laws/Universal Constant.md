# Universal Constant

## In-Universe Definition

The Universal Constant is a limitation on magic users, even if one has all the right requirements, one might simply be unable to.

## Truth

In truth, it is a limitation of the magical system, where a small percentage (<0.01%) of people are simply unable to use magic. Their capacity and ability to control magic simply do not exist. This can be recitified by a Deity removing said block.
