# Godly

<sub>Author's Note: This is a first draft, edits are likely going to happen.</sub>

An element exclusive to the 90 deities of Opportunity. All other races, including demigods, have `-100` affinity to this element. The amount of affinity determines one's ranking in the hierarchy of deities, where having more is higher. Though none can pass the Deity of Creation's `Infinity`, some are far beyond everyone else's reach, like Creation.

This element allows for powerful reality manipulation and increases affinity with all other elements depending on its own affinity.

## Reality Manipulation

A Godly element user can manipulate and modify reality, to certain extents. The deity's domain matters as well, where generally deities of a more broad domain find it easier to manipulate reality.

People with very high (from a mortal perspective) affinities for Ahshaka, Void and Nyra are very resistant to this manipulation, even with their own consent. Though those cases are rare, as the affinity has to be beyond `150`.

## Affinity Levels

Due to the Godly element, all other affinities of the deity are increased several times. Generally, the amounts increased and of which elements are dictated by their domain. For example, a nature-domain deity would find unnatural elements' affinities raised less than natural ones.
