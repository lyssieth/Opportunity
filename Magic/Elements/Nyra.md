# Nyra

<sub>Author's Note: This is a first draft, edits are likely going to happen.</sub>

This magic can be used as a substitute for any element, excluding Void, Nyra, Godly and Ahshaka. Instead of being a perfect substitute, it actually empowers the magic being used. So, the same spell cast using Nyra instead of another element will be more powerful.

This power increase is based off of the user's affinity to Nyra, and lack of affinity to the element. The larger this difference, the greater the increase.  
The difference is calculated as follows: `nyra affinity - element affinity`. If the difference is zero, there's no difference. If the difference is greater than zero, there's an increase, and if it's below zero there's a decrease.
