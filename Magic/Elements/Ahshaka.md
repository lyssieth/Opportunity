# Ahshaka

<sub>Author's Note: This is a first draft, edits are likely going to happen.</sub>

An element which allows the manipulation of mana, and enchanting items which are receptive to enchantments. It also allows sensing mana and mana signatures.  
This element rarely has users above 35 affinity, and most continents don't even have double digits of people who are at an affionity greater than 55.  
Since affinity isn't something that can be predicted before a child's birth, several countries have put in place mandatory affinity measurements once the child becomes an adult.

## Mana Sensing

Ahshaka users with an affinity greater than 50 can inherently sense the flows and usage of mana in their surroundings, as well as (without effort) differentiate magical signatures from each other. This ability has to be trained over years at lower affinities.  

## Mana Manipulation

The initial process is much the same as casting, however one doesn't expend their own mana, and can instead manipulate ambient or another's mana. The greater the affinity, the greater the amount which can be manipulated.

Certain users have managed to not just manipulate, but change the element of the magic that was manipulated, however this art has been lost to time and the slowly declining amount of known Ahshaka users.

## Enchanting

Enchanting is the process of inscribing runes upon the surface of a material, which when fed with ambient mana, can be used to power magic that'd normally require casting. An enchanter doesn't need any affinity in the element they enchant, *but* a lack of affinity makes it harder to be knowledgeable enough on the element to inscribe the correct runes.

Most metals can be enchanted, with the exception of Orichalcum, Cobalt, and Dragonsteel (derivatives included). Other enchantable materials are certain types of wood, some rarer variants of stone, and all gems.  
The amount of enchantments that can be placed on an item is generally determined by its quality. The best enchantments can only do so much for a low-quality weapon.
