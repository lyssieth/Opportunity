# Chrono

This element allows the manipulation of time, and peeking into the past or the future or potential alternate timelines.

It is a rare element to have affinity for, and it's restricted by its Deity in order to not allow breaking the natural order.

## Manipulation of Time

One can speed up, slow down, or freeze time. Depending on their abilities, they can either do it in a small area, on an object, or rarely across the world.  
They can also choose to only do it for specific targets. Theoretically, this could also be used to move backwards in time, *however* the Deity of the element prevents this from happening.
