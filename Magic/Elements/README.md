# Elements

The main elements are described in this file, with some of the unique ones getting their own files.

## Affinities

Affinities are a range from `-100` to `Infinity`, where anything above 100 means there's no detriment to using the element. The benefits are generally a simple amplification of the effects. Unique cases will have them described, and unique elements (ones with links) will be described in their own files.

If affinity is at or below 0, one is unable to use that element at all. Generally for most races, affinities fall between 20 and 100, with exceptions.  
Negative affinity generally means weakness or, in extreme cases, repulsion from an element. It is extremely rare for it to reach even -10.

'Opposite' elements don't affect the affinity of the 'opposite'

## Combinations and Interactions

Elements can be combined, and they will interact to enhance or change the effect.  
Almost all elements can combine, even elements which would oppose each other, though one would need great affinity and control to combine opposing elements.

## Opposing Elements and Interactions

If an unique element (ones with a link) has any opposing elements or unique interactions, they will be in their respective file.

### Angelic and Demonic

They interact destructively (think matter/antimatter), being the hardest elements to combine successfully.

Both can pierce the other's defense, and both sides generally only use their respective element for offense rather than defense.
