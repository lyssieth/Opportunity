# Elements

The main elements are described in this file, with some of the unique ones getting their own files.

## Affinities

Affinities are a range from `-100` to `Infinity`, where anything above 100 means there's no detriment to using the element.

If affinity is below 0, one is unable to use that element at all. Generally for most races, affinities fall between 20 and 100, with exceptions.

'Opposite' elements don't affect the affinity of the 'opposite'
