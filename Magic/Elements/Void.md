# Void

An element strictly controlled by its deity, Elaran. It is a multi-purpose element, which can take the position of a lot of elements, in all major categories (offense, defense, support).

<sub>Author's Note: Only its unique features are listed in this file, for now.</sub>

## Void Weapons

Any user of the Void element can draw on 'Void Weapons'. They are weapons constructed out of pure Void magic. The user needs an affinity around 50 or higher, for these weapons to be able to be manifested.

These weapons all have a life steal effect. Whenever an attack is 'completed' (sword slash ends, arrow impacts, etc.), all damage dealt by the weapon is used as a powerful White magic healing spell surrounding the caster, affecting only ones the caster considers an ally. The range is about 5 meters, with a conversion rate of 1:1, at `100` affinity.

All of these weapons can only truly be blocked by Void magic.

### Void Sword

It takes the form of a one-handed sword. It is ethereal, yet can attack flesh just the same. If it is available, it will attack the victim's soul, not just the body.

It can also take the form of a two-handed one.

### Void Bow

It takes the form of a shortbow, with arrows generated from magic as the bowstring is drawn. The arrows can be fired out at speeds greater than most normal magic can reach, with no external effects being able to block it.

### Void Staff

It takes the form of a wizard's staff. This is the least visually-obvious Void Weapon, as its form has no indications of Void other than the pitch black color of the gem at the tip of the staff. The staff is generally made out of a silver metal, though there are cases where it's wood or stone. At its tip, sealed per the material's style, is a black gemstone.

This staff acts as any other staff would, amplifying all magic usage. However, it does not affect Void itself.

## Void Armor

Users with affinity greater than `150` can start to manifest Void Armor, though it is impossible to make armor that fully covers one's body no matter the affinity. This armor costs a lot of internal mana to sustain, but can block any attack on the user's body, and is invisible. The armor is pitch black, and looks like metal plate armor. The user can see through it.

## Elaran's Blessing

One Void element user can receive Elaran's Blessing, giving them the highest possible affinity for Void, for their race. They also gain several other boons.

The basic boons are an increased life expectancy, regenerative abilities, and being able to tap into the Void Plane and its functions as a mana battery. It also allows customizing the appearance of Void Weapons and Void Armor.

### Passive Armor

Whenever the Void magic detects a lethal attack, Void Armor will automatically be activated on the user. This armor takes less than 50 milliseconds to fully cover the body, and it starts covering from where the strike would hit. It creates a fully-encasing set of armor.

### Summoning Elaran

One can summon Elaran from the Void Plane. However, they cannot stick around very long, simply because they do not wish to.

Elaran's unique effects and abilities will be described in their own file.

### Void Wings

ONe can create prehensile feathered wings out of pure Void magic. They can be used as normal wings, or modified and moved freely to attack or defend.

### Death Prevention

Only ever seen among the `Elarangarde` bloodline, and even then it is extremely rare.  
If the current heir or head (heir prioritized) of the `Elarangarde` bloodline also has Elaran's Blessing, and extreme luck, they will be unable to die. They can still feel the pain, and their body and soul can be destroyed, however they will completely resurrect five hours after their death, with no side effects. There is no way to go against this effect without Elaran's permission.

<sub>Author's Note: there are more abilities under the Blessing, but I need to work on them more.</sub>
