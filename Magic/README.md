# Magic

Magic in the world of Opportunity is a relatively common thing.  
Ability and usage of magic depends on the following factors:

- affinity (affinity to elements)
- mana purity (density and ability to store one's mana)
- mana control (ability to control one's mana to make what one imagines happen)
- imagination (ability to picture what one wishes to happen in their mind)

## Electricity

Electricity can be converted almost straight into mana using a complex magic circle. The conversion ratio is roughly a kilowatt per `0.8` "units" of mana.

This "unit" is generally described as amount of charge in a perfect second-class Mana Crystal. Specifically, it is `0.00021%`. Second-class Mana Crystals, when full, can power a simple light for millennia. Turning mana into light is more efficient than any modern method of turning electricity into light.
