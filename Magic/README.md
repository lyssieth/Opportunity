# Magic

Magic in the world of Opportunity is a relatively common thing.  
Ability and usage of magic depends on the following factors:

- affinity (affinity to elements)
- mana purity (density and ability to store one's mana)
- mana control (ability to control one's mana to make what one imagines happen)
- imagination (ability to picture what one wishes to happen in their mind)
