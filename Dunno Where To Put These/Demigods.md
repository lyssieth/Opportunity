# Demigods

Demigods can be of any sentient race, however they are generally anthropomorphic. They wield powers granted by their Deity, as well as any they had before becoming a Demigod.

Most Deities allow them to live in the Deity's personal plane, or the Heavenly Plane. Rarely are they forced to live elsewhere.
