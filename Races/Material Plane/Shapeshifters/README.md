# Shapeshifters

A race of beings capable of changing their appearance.

They are viewed as heretical or evil in many countries and factions.

## Appearance (Base Form)

Their base form is that of a black smokey/wispy blob, like a floating ball of viscous liquid.

## Age

Shapeshifters generally live up to 1000 years, with the highest possible age being 1100 years.

## Abilities

### Physical

Dependent on their form and race, but a bit amplified.

### Magical

Capable of having many affinities.

Incapable of using Ahkasha, however they can have affinity for it.

### Unique

#### Shapeshifting

Most members of this race can shapeshift into inanimate objects relatively freely, with sie constraints based on their training in shapeshifting. Living beings, however, require them having had physical contact with the race before being able to transform into it. And, to be able to freely modify their appearance, they need to have a deep understanding of the race, as well as be well-trained in shapeshifting.

Ranged form acquisition is possible, however it is extremely rare (1/100000).

They cannot be killed with physical attacks while transformed, however if they lose consciousness and receive an attack, there is a high chance they will return to their base form.  
Magical attacks, however, can kill them.

#### Affinity Control

In rare cases (1/10000), a Shapeshifter can move their affinity scores around.
This effect generally only lasts a few minutes, though can be taken up to an hour with training.

For example, they can move 5 points of affinity from one element to another.
