# Sun Elves

An uncommon sub-race of elf.

## Appearance

Warmer skin and orange/red/yellow hair. Generally orange or brown eyes.

## Age

They live about as long as Dark Elves.

## Abilities

### Physical

They are a bit stronger and more durable than normal Elves, but nowhere near Draco-Elves.

### Magical

Preference towards Fire, Arcane, Earth and Spatial. Generally 2-3 strong affinities (1 from preferences, 1-2 from non-preferences), and many weaker ones.

### Unique

Sun Elves can regenerate mana rapidly in direct sunlight, and can also channel the sun's energy into spells three times a day, enhancing the effect greatly and almost removing the cast time. This power can only be used in direct sunlight.

Their flames are generally hotter.
