# Elves

A more common race on the Material Plane, but not the most common. They have some sub-races, and are usually viewed (by themselves) as superior to humans.

## Sub-races

- [Dark Elves](Dark%20Elves.md)
- [High Elves](High%20Elves.md)
- [Draco-Elves](Draco-Elves.md)
- [Moon Elves](Moon%20Elves.md)
- [Sun Elves](Sun%20Elves.md)

## Appearance

Just Elves from generic fantasy.

### Height

Average adult height ranges from 6ft0 to 7ft.

## Age

The average for any elf is between 700 to around 3 millennia at the higher end. The true range depends on the sub-race.

## Abilities

### Physical

Much more agile and dextrous compared to humans, but weaker in terms of strength and durability.

### Magical

They generally have fewer, but stronger, affinities. Generic Elves have no preference towards any type of magic.
