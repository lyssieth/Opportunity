# Moon Elves

A rare sub-type of Elf, only able to be born uner a full moon.

## Appearance

Very pale, with white hair (sometimes with light bluish accents), and blue or white/light gray eyes.

### Height

Somewhat shorter than normal Elves, randing from 5ft8 to 6ft7.

## Age

The average is around 80 millennia, with the lower end being 60 and the higher being above a thousand. They are the second-longest in terms of lifespan.

## Abilities

### Physical

Equal to Dark Elves when it comes to agility and dexterity, but weaker than normal Elves.

### Magical

Preference towards Ice, Ahshaka, Spatial, and Creation elements. Generally 1-2 strong affinities (from preferences), one strong (chosen from non-preferences), and a few weak (chosen from non-preferences). They almost never have sub-10 affinity to any non-restricted element.

### Unique

Under moonlight, depending on the current stage of the moon, they gain increased power. Under a full moon, a single apprentice Moon Elf is stronger than any other advanced (education and training wise) sub-race of Elf.  
Under a new moon, young Moon Elves are weakened. Starting at age 25, this weakness starts to fade.
