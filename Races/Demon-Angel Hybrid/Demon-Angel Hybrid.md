# Demon-Angel Hybrid

## Unwished Accidents

---

### General Information

An extremely rare mix, in most cases a result of vicious rape by the Demon. And even then, the chance of a live birth is next to zero. Abortion is the most common next step, as this mix is viewed by Angels as absolute demonic heresy. If one manages to survive, they are likely cast out and forced to live out their lives on the mortal plane, or amongst Demons.
These hybrids have not been observed between Lilin and Arenius yet, but the chances of sexual relations between those subtypes are an infinitesimal amount away from zero. It is, however, possible for one such hybrid to exist, given the chain of extremely low chances all passing successfully.
And, of course, Elder Lilin and High Arenius are even closer to zero than standard Lilin/Arenius. This comes down to the fact there's only 11 Elder Lilin and less than 10 High Arenius.

### Appearance

They share features of both Angels and Demons. As for which half is which, it is usually random, an almost 50/50 split between right side being Demon and right side being Angel.

#### Height

Height is based on genetics of both parents, with a lean towards the taller side.

#### Specifics

For the following information, the right side will be the Demon side.

##### Head

A line of horns in a half-circle along the top of their head &mdash; anywhere from just 2 to 6 &mdash; on the right side. Both ends of which connect into the halo on the left side, which, while it glows, darkens noticeably in the centimeter of so along the center line.

A Demonic eye &mdash; usually red or purple &mdash; on the right. It glows whenever they use Demonic magic, also leaving a trail if in motion.
The other eye is that of an Angel &mdash; either golden or a lighter shade of blue, teal, or green &mdash; on the left. It glows whenever they use Angelic magic, again leaving a trail if in motion.

Occasionally cracks are visible after extreme power usage, starting near the eyes (specifically whichever eye is associated with the power) and continuing outwards. This recovers slowly over time &mdash; from days to weeks &mdash; depending on severity.

Hair is split down the middle along a rough transition, with the right side usually dark. Most commonly blacks and reds, though there are cases of purple and even a flame-like gradient. On the left, it's light colors. Variants of blonde, with very few cases of other light colors, like a white-ish pink or very light blues and greens.

##### Torso and Arms

Relatively normal. Slightly sharper and longer nails on the demonic side. Skin on the left is slightly more responsive to sun damage.

##### Wings

==TBD==

##### Tail

It is rare for a hybrid such as this to have a tail, but in the cases when they do, it is entirely Demonic.

##### Legs

No difference from a regular Angel, and even then there's no major differences from a human.

### Abilities

#### Physical Abilities

Stronger than an average Angel or Demon, as well as faster and more agile. Most are capable of lifting around a ton, and running faster than the fastest land animals. Dodging is easy too, as they are flexible and fast to react, especially when combined with their ability to alter time perception.

#### Mental Abilities

A strong mind in both intelligence and wisdom. Strong capacity to resist mental manipulation, whether social engineering, magical, or even natural. Very fast learners.
They, as with both Angels and Demons, can slow down their perception of time down to about $\frac 1 5$ of realtime. This is faster than both Angels and Demons, and can also vary by a few percent. During this, both eyes will glow faintly. Ability usage will override this.

#### Magical Abilities

Sharing the magical capabilities of both Demons and Angels, they can obviously use Demonic and Angelic magic, as well as most medium-high level spells. They still require knowledge of the spell to use it, but can likely mimic it with relatively high effectivity after someone else has used it a few times, even without a chant. The exact capacity is highly dependent on their parents.

#### Weaknesses and Bonuses

As an unnatural and unpleasant mix of both Angel and Demon, they share both the weaknesses and the bonuses of both sides. Any bonuses or weaknesses are added together.

##### Magic

If the weaknesses and bonuses were to cancel out, the weakness instead takes priority. So, unlike the nigh-complete resistance to holy magic of Angels, they are as weak as a Demon to it instead. And vice versa for the demonic magic of Demons.

##### Physical

Physically, however, if the weaknesses and bonuses were to cancel out, the bonus takes priority.

##### Mental

As with physical, bonuses take priority.

---

### Troubles

High likelihood of trauma, mental or physical.

#### Mental

Various amounts of depression, suicidal thoughts, and general lack of self-worth. Often they view themselves as mistakes or as lesser than an insect.
Complete (external) lack of emotion isn't unlikely.

#### Physical

Likely victims of abuse by either parents or those who find them before they reach a state where they can defend themselves properly.

---

### Fetishes

Dominance and submissiveness is based on which parent's genes are more dominant. If it's the Demon's, they are likely to lean much more towards submissiveness, while if it's the Angel's, they are likely to lean towards dominance. In a few cases it could be roughly somewhere in the middle.
An unnatural enjoyment of pain received from others, often viewed as over the top even by  masochists. To them it doesn't matter whether it's mental or physical.

### Public Opinion

Viewed as an amalgam of both holy and unholy, they are mistreated extremely. From simple, insulting comments to being openly attacked or enslaved. Few settlements even allow them entry unless they hide their features. Magical hiding is usually viewed as easier and more effective, yet few learn it due to having nothing to learn from.

#### Angelic Opinion

Viewed as demonic heretics and hunted without prejudice. There are groups dedicated to hunting down and killing every last hybrid.

#### Demonic Opinion

While they are viewed as lower than a Fallen, they are still seen as equivalent to a Demon, and thus allowed free access to Hell, and its many opportunities for safety or even a "normal" life.

#### Gods' Opinion

The gods don't really give a shit.
