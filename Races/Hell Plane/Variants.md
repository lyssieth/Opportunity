# Variants

There are twelve variants of demons.

NOTE: Not all variants are listed. Only ones currently related to existing lore are.

## Plain

Ruled over by Arakas Morath, the first Daughter of Lilith (though they generally prefer to be male, they still have the title of being Lilith's Daughter).

They are the most plain variant of demon, about equal to a human in terms of amount of affinities, as well as Demonic and Nether.

They are physically quite strong.

## Pale

Ruled over by Kilith'Shair, the seventh Daughter of Lilith.

The second most powerful variant of Demon, with strong affinity to almost all elements.
They also have both Angelic and Demonic, as well as resistance to both. They are also the rarest variant of demon.

## Runic

Ruled over by Li'Ashara, the third Daughter of Lilith.

They are powerful with runic and spell circle based magic, constructing elaborate spells without needing to imagine the entire thing at one time. They have mild affinity for all elements, and very high affinity for Ahshaka, however are incapable of using it to affect others' magic without using a rune or a spell circle.

## Blood

Ruled over by Arai'Iasha, the ninth Daughter of Lilith.

They are powerful in magic involving the sacrifice of blood. Summoning, contracts, binding magic, anything of the sort fits under this. They have very high physical strength, toughness, and regeneration. Their magic is generally based on sacrificing a bit of blood to enhance their affinities for a short period of time.
