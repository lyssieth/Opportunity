# High Arenius

There are almost always nine High Arenius, as the Heavenly Plane cannot support any more, due to a restriction set in place by a powerful Deity.

They are an advanced form of Arenius, boasting more power, but cannot be resurrected.

## Appearance

Generally human/elf in appearance, based on parents.

In all cases, High Arenius have a golden halo. Explained more in Magical Abilities.

### Height

Their height is based on their 'base race', as well as their parents, genetically decided.

### Wings

THeir wings are generally large, feathered, and white. However a bit of tint variation is possible. Larger than normal Arenius wings.

## Abilities

### Physical Abilities

Physically very strong, and fast. Flexibility and dexterity are also high. Very durable, and hard to wound. All of these even more so than Arenius.

### Mental Abilities

Very intelligent, and very resistant to mental attacks as well. Their learning speed is massively increased.  
They can alter their perception of time down to about `1/35` of realtime, however it can vary between `1/30` and `1/40`, depending on their skills and mana purity.

### Magical Abilities

Magically very capable. Their primary affinity is of course Angelic, but they generally have almost all others at a high level.

Their Mana Purity builds slower, but has a much greater effect at all levels.

#### Halo

The halo grants the same bonuses as Arenius halos.

### Weaknesses and Bonuses

#### Magic

Weak to Demonic magic, but resistant against Angelic. Light resistance to most other elements, usually below 33%.

#### Physical

They have a very high passive regeneration, even for large and fatal wounds.  

#### Mental
