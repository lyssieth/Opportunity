# True Angels

The second most common race on the Heavenly Plane, and the second weakest. Almost always used as more competent soldiers, 'veterans' almost. They reincarnate as a new True Angel upon death, keeping all memory. This allows them to quickly return to whatever they were doing.
The primary source of True Angels are 'promoted' Plain Angels, those who display more advanced thoughts or skills. They can still reproduce sexually as well, though it is viewed as a slower way of increasing numbers. They grow up very quick though, after birth, taking only two years to become equivalent in size and ability to a freshly reincarnated Plain Angel.

## Appearance

Despite their previous lives, the True Angels remain very close to humans.

### Height

Height is based on their previous Plain Angel, or parents, whichever is applicable.

### Specifics

For the following information, they are born from two other True Angels. All features are, unless otherwise specified, independent of parents.

#### Head

In uncommon cases a golden halo forms above their head, glowing softly. It is just barely bright enough to light up most of a pitch black room.

Eyes are either golden or a lighter shade of blue, teal, or green. In almost all cases the eyes glow whenever using Angelic magic.

Hair is usually light colors. Variants of blonde, with very few cases of other light colors, like a white-ish pink or very light blues and greens.

#### Torso and Arms

Based on Plain Angel genetics, or parents, whichever is applicable.

#### Wings

Wing size is varied, from the bare minimum to fly effectively, to much larger than required. Parents only rarely influence their size.

#### Legs

Based on Plain Angel genetics, or parents, whichever is applicable. Also almost indistinguishable from a human.

## Abilities

### Physical Abilities

On average, much stronger, faster and more agile than humans and elves. Over half are capable of lifting around 5-6 average humans worth of weight. Decently fast, though outmatched by many land animals. Flexible and fast-reacting, using their altered time perception almost always.
Equivalent to Plain Angels.

### Mental Abilities

Intelligent and wise. Somewhat more resistant to social engineering and magical or natural mind manipulation, compared to Plain Angels. They learn faster than Plain Angels.
They can alter their perception of time down to about $\frac 3 10$ of realtime. The full amount can vary by a few percent. During this both eyes glow softly, though this is overridden by ability usage. The glow of the halo dims during this as well.

### Magical Abilities

Capable of using Angelic magic, as well as 99% low to medium level spells. They require knowledge of the spell to use it, capable of mimicking spells after training by an experienced user. Magical capacity is greater than that of a Plain Angel, by about 1.25x.

### Weaknesses and Bonuses

#### Magic

Slightly less weak to Demonic magic if compared to a Plain Angel, but almost completely resistant against Angelic magic. Light resistance against most other magic types, usually below 15%.

#### Physical

Fast regeneration and energy replenishment. Quite easy to predict.

#### Mental

Weak to having their past used as blackmail, or as an attack. Weak to psychological attacks. Likely to get tunnel-visioned if killed multiple times by the same enemy.

## Public Opinion

Indistinguishable from Plain Angels to most humans and other species.

Elves view them as superior Angels.

Dwarves don't care about the differences.

### Angelic Opinion

Viewed as one of the best options for a frontline, second wave soldier. Infinitely replenishing, so therefore a very useful combatant or worker.

### Demonic Opinion

Viewed as weak pawns, something easy to deal with, yet like an annoying pest that keeps returning.

### Gods' Opinion

Viewed as pawns, useful for somewhat more complex tasks that can require some effort.
