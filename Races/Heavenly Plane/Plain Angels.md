# Plain Angels

The most common race on the Heavenly Plane, and the weakest. Often drafted as soldiers to fight on the front lines. They reincarnate as a new Plain Angel upon death, losing complex memories, but not muscle memory and simpler memories. This allows Angels to nigh-infinitely replenish forces.
The primary source of Plain Angels are dead humanoids, from just humans to elves and dwarves, or even more unique ones like reptilian people and other such mixes. They can still reproduce sexually as well, though it is viewed as a slower way of increasing numbers. They grow up very quick though, after birth, taking only two years to become equivalent in size and ability to a freshly reincarnated Plain Angel.

## Appearance

Despite their previous lives, the Plain Angels remain very close to humans.

### Height

Height is based on their previous life, or parents, whichever is applicable.

### Specifics

For the following information, they are born from two other Plain Angels. All features are, unless otherwise specified, independent of parents.

#### Head

In rare cases a golden halo forms above their head, glowing softly. It is not bright enough to light up much of a pitch black room.

Eyes are either golden or a lighter shade of blue, teal, or green. In some cases the eyes glow whenever using Angelic magic.

Hair is usually light colors. Variants of blonde, with very few cases of other light colors, like a white-ish pink or very light blues and greens.

#### Torso and Arms

Based on previous life's genetics, or parents, whichever is applicable.

#### Wings

Wing size is varied, from the bare minimum to fly effectively, to much larger than required. Parents only rarely influence their size.

#### Legs

Based on previous life's genetics, or parents, whichever is applicable. Also almost indistinguishable from a human.

## Abilities

### Physical Abilities

On average, much stronger, faster and more agile than humans and elves. Over half are capable of lifting around 5-6 average humans worth of weight. Decently fast, though outmatched by many land animals. Flexible and fast-reacting, using their altered time perception almost always.

### Mental Abilities

Intelligent and decently wise, but rarely with much important knowledge. Mildly resistant to social engineering and magical or natural mind manipulation. They learn quickly, which is advantageous for life.
They can alter their perception of time down to about $\frac 1 3$ of realtime. The full amount can vary by a few percent. During this both eyes glow softly, though this is overridden by ability usage. The glow of the halo dims during this as well.

### Magical Abilities

Capable of using Angelic magic, as well as most low to medium level spells. They require knowledge of the spell to use it, but this is something they keep between reincarnations, unless it is a fairly complex medium level spell. Magical capacity is within a few percent of the average, being equivalent to a powerful elf.

### Weaknesses and Bonuses

#### Magic

Weak to Demonic magic, but very resistant against Angelic magic. Light resistance against most other magic types, usually below 10%.

#### Physical

Fast regeneration, but get tired faster.

#### Mental

Immune to having their past used as a method of attack, as they do not have any way to remember their own past.

## Public Opinion

Indistinguishable from True Angels to most humans and other species.

Elves view them as lesser Angels.

Dwarves don't care about the differences.

### Angelic Opinion

Viewed as a perfect frontline soldier. Infinitely replenishing and fast to recover skills, as well as capable of independent thought unlike most constructs.

### Demonic Opinion

Viewed as weak pawns, something easy to deal with, yet like an annoying pest that keeps returning.

### Gods' Opinion

Viewed as pawns, useful for simple tasks that do not require much effort.
