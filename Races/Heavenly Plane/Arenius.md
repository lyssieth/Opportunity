# Arenius

The primary 'citizen' race of the Heavenly Plane. They're the soldiers, but also leaders, shopkeeps, and many other roles. Upon death, they can be resurrected, but it is expensive to do so.

Arenius are generally born from either a forcibly-evolved True Angel, or simply from their parents. Their appearances are genetically decided.

## Appearance

Generally human/elf in appearance, based on parents.

In certain cases, Arenius can have a golden halo, however it's rare. Explained more in Magical Abilities.

### Height

Their height is based on their 'base race', as well as their parents, genetically decided.

### Wings

THeir wings are generally large, feathered, and white. However a bit of tint variation is possible.

## Abilities

### Physical Abilities

Physically very strong, and fast. Flexibility and dexterity are also high. Very durable, and hard to wound.

### Mental Abilities

Very intelligent, and pretty resistant to mental attacks as well. Their learning speed is increased.  
They can alter their perception of time down to about `1/15` of realtime, however it can vary between `1/12` and `1/18`, depending on their parents and luck, and skills.

### Magical Abilities

Magically very capable. Their primary affinity is of course Angelic, but they generally have 5-6 others at a high level. If resurrected, they lose mana purity.

#### Halo

Arenius with a halo gain a few bonuses. Such as:

- being much more powerful magically
- being more capaable of slowing their time perception
- being tougher physically

### Weaknesses and Bonuses

#### Magic

Weak to Demonic magic, but resistant against Angelic. Light resistance to most other elements, usually below 25%.

#### Physical

They have a very high passive regeneration, but large wounds can't be treated by it.  
Wings can't be moved as quickly as other parts of their body, making them easier targets.

#### Mental

N/A

Viewed as a threat.

Viewed as followers and people, equivalent to elves or humans or any other fully sentient and civilized race.
