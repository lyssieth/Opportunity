# Public Mana Infrastructure

Due to all cities containing a City Core, the cities have infrastructure in place for sharing mana among homes and businesses. There is local storage (using Mana Crystals), and they're transported using Mana Conduits. (This entire system somewhat mirrors the modern electrical grid, except it's on a city-by-city basis.)
