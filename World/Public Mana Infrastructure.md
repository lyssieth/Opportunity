# Public Mana Infrastructure

Due to all cities containing a City Core, the cities have infrastructure in place for sharing mana among homes and businesses. There is local storage both on-site and at the Core (using Mana Crystals), and they're transported using Mana Conduits, which act as connectors. (This entire system somewhat mirrors the modern electrical grid, except it's on a city-by-city basis.)

So, to put this in electrical grid terms

Mana Crystals are both substations and storage
Mana Conduits are cables
City Core is a generator and storage
