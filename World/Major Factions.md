# Major Factions

## Liricore

### Six Elven Kings

Over half of the continent is owned by the Six Elven Kings, a faction consisting of six individual kingdoms all allied together. They are generally very friendly, and have had talks of becoming one large nation instead of six kingdoms. There are a lot of elf sub-species here, though notably missing are Draco-elves.

### Lilrik Alliance

A lot of small and medium countries on the eastern side of the continent are brought under one umbrella by a powerful, but small, kingdom. The kingdom's armies are capable of taming dragons, which gives them their unique status.

## Porloros

There are no factions of note on Porloros, however there used to be one in the now-uninhabitable lands.

### Uninhabitable

Almost the entire western half of the continent is uninhabitable, due to the 'Great Scar' and the effects it has on its surroundings. People often still enter it, seeking enlightenment or an escape, however they are rarely ever seen again.

Formerly, this land was owned by several human countries.

## Auraopa

Several beast and dwarf races live on this continent, however there are no factions of note.

## Srairkar

Almost entirely dominated by one faction.

### The Silver Mountains

A faction built around a large mountain range spanning the continent in the north-south direction, and the countries beside it. Almost all races congregate here, as it is the most welcoming place. They are equal in power to the Six Elven Kings, despite their much greater size.
