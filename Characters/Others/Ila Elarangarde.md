# Ila Elarangarde

Ila is a human, around the age of 19 by appearance. She is the cause of the 'Great Scar', on the continent of Porloros, though the details of which are not common knowledge anymore.

She was commonly known as the 'Broken Dragon Queen', though now she is simply treated as a slave.

## Appearance

She is a pale-skinned human with purple eyes, which have dragon-like pupils and irises. Her hair is black, and long. There's a (seemingly) artificial black-purple rose in her hair, visible from the side or the front.

Her clothes are generally noble-esque clothes, though different masters order her to wear different clothes. Some may order plainer clothes, other fancier clothes.

Her eyes seem to have no life to them, and her face not voice express no emotions.

## Abilities

Almost all of her strength (physical, magical, mental) appeared after the events of [The Incident](#the-incident-11). Befoe that, she was simply an average human with very strong Void affinity, and Elaran's Blessing.

### Physical

She is superhuman by all measures, and can hold her own against many other races even if magic is excluded.

### Magical

She has strong affinity for all non-restricted magic. She also has especially strong affinity for Void.  
She is the only one with Elaran's Blessing, being the last descendant of the Elarangarde family, with all the benefits it provides.  
Her mana purity and control are both excellent, though her imagination is weaker. She's focused on simplicity, as in making her magic appear as simple as possible.

### Mental

She is mentally immune to all manipulation and attempts to access it, however her mind is broken, and she is forced to serve as a slave due to her 'training'. She is however extremely intelligent and with a perfect memory.

## Public Opinion

She is unknown to most.

### Angelic Opinion

The Angels view her as a rather large threat, however she cannot do anything to them without a master's order. They have attempted to claim her, but it seems she is unable to be claimed by angels.

### Demonic Opinion

Basically the same as [Angelic Opinion](#angelic-opinion), however they also view her as a useful tool if she could be controlled.

### Gods' Opinion

#### Elaran

Views her as its heir.

#### Others

Don't really care.

## Backstory

### Early Years (0-9)

Ila was born to the King and Queen of Miar Kila. It is a mostly-human kingdom. Its location is in the Shi'ar Mountains of the Porloros Continent. Surrounded by many other kinds of kingdoms, she had to learn many languages.
Ila was like many other kids. Young, curious about everything. Unlike some, she was great at everything, from magic to various topics in school, et cetera.
The most noteworthy incident is her 7th birthday, when she first met the dragon, within the Void Plane. The dragon would later come to use the name Elaran. They were happy together, for a while. Most of her time was still spent outside the Void Plane, yet she visited often. Her magic developed after this date as well.

### The Collapse (10)

War, the gift she received for her tenth birthday. Her kingdom fell in weeks. She managed to escape with a group of guards. Ila was subject to a very large bounty. The rewards were never paid out. The guards met their ends, and Ila was taken. As the only rightful heir to Miar Kila, she was a valuable prize. Her captors were the adjacent human-supremacist kingdom, ruled by a Tyrant.

She fought back, of course. But there was nothing she could do alone, and afraid, against thousands of men and women, mages and warriors... She didn't use Elaran until the end, when it was already too late. Nobody dared use anything close to lethal against her. No arrows were fired, no blades or spikes...

### Captured and Afraid (10 continued)

Taken into slavery, her mind was re-conditioned, with magical and physical methods. She was still quite rebellious in her captive state. She was forced to wear a collar that prevented magic, as well as acting as a fail-safe. With a simple thought, it was capable of knocking her out. She was unable to do anything. In rare occasions it was disabled, but she had no choice but to follow her Master's orders, or risk the fail-safe.
She was passed from Master to Master, from Mistress to Mistress... she would never last long anywhere. Sure, her status made her a great prize, but it was not worth the effort it took to maintain her needs.

### The Incident (11)

During one particularly calm morning, Ila managed to break the collar. She lashed out, drawing Elaran to the real world, splitting reality itself to do so. A method so dangerous, it could've killed her before she could stop it.

It was here where she became known as the Broken Dragon Queen. As the only heir or Miar Kila, she was the Queen. Hundreds of thousands died, across the kingdom and surrounding areas. Yet, it was clear the process broke her. She was not the same after the battle finally subsided, and the dragon was banished to their realm once more. She was captured again, but was found... completely broken. Her memories were gone, her mind left blank. An emotionless husk of her prior self. She was pale as a Moon Elf, but without any of the Elven qualities.
She returned to training again, but they found her to accept every order, and complete it without any fuss. A truly perfect slave, unable to rebel... unless it was to do with her realm, the dragon within, or the deep black rose she had since the incident. There were attempts made to uncover her past. They were met with strong resistance, often resulting in her forcing herself unconscious. If she couldn't do so, like if blocked by a collar, she did everything she could to fight, but did not attack anyone but herself.

### Aftermath of the Battle

The remains from the intense battle that took place remain untouched by time. They are dangerous to any visitors due to the various rifts in reality dotted around the place. It spans across most of the kingdom which captured her, and even into some of the surrounding areas. A massive scar on the planet, visible from space.

### Aftermath of Ila (11+)

She was, again, a slave. She never needed anything, couldn't want anything, nor felt anything. She was often forced to the most dirty, grueling jobs. Her status remains forgotten.

Her aging was as normal. Her teens came and went like a subtle gust. No changes, except growing.

### Further Aftermath (19)

On orders from her master, she used powerful magic and alchemy to prevent herself from aging. She would forever remain 19, a broken slave sold and bought by many. On occasions, even extraterrestrial entities, however she returned to the world of Opportunity every time. In rare cases, she allowed her owners into the realm, but none ever met the dragon. It mimicked whatever her surroundings were when entered and omitted any life smarter than an insect.
