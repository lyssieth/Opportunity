# Ila Elarangarde

Ila is a human, around the age of 19 by appearance. She is the cause of the 'Great Scar', on the continent of Porloros, though the details of which are not common knowledge anymore.

She was commonly known as the 'Broken Dragon Queen', though now she is simply treated as a slave.

## Appearance

She is a pale-skinned human with purple eyes, which have dragon-like pupils and irises. Her hair is black, and long. There's a (seemingly) artificial black-purple rose in her hair, visible from the side or the front.

Her clothes are generally noble-esque clothes, though different masters order her to wear different clothes. Some may order plainer clothes, other fancier clothes.

Her eyes seem to have no life to them, and her face not voice express no emotions.

## Abilities

### Physical

She is superhuman by all measures, and can hold her own against many other races even if magic is excluded.

### Magical

She has strong affinity for all non-restricted magic, excluding Ahshaka. She also has especially strong affinity for Void.

She is the only one with Elaran's Blessing, being the last descendant of the Elarangarde family, with all the benefits it provides.

Her mana purity and control are both excellent, though her imagination is weaker. She's focused on simplicity, as in making her magic appear as simple as possible.

### Mental

She is mentally immune to all manipulation and attempts to access it, however her mind is broken, and she is forced to serve as a slave due to her 'training'. She is however extremely intelligent and with a perfect memory.

## Public Opinion

She is unknown to most.

### Angelic Opinion

The Angels view her as a rather large threat, however she cannot do anything to them without a master's order. They have attempted to claim her, but it seems she is unable to be claimed by angels.

### Demonic Opinion

Basically the same as [Angelic Opinion](#angelic-opinion), however they also view her as a useful tool if she could be controlled.

### Gods' Opinion

#### Elaran

Views her as its heir.

#### Others

Don't really care.
